# Starlight Cargo

## Overview

**This is the server portion of the application. For the server implementation and source code, please check the repository: (StarLight Cargo CLI) [https://github.com/darkphotonKN/starlight-cargo-cli].**

This application serves as a Distributed File Storage System. At its core it allows users to store and retrieve files that are carefully
stored across mutliple servers / nodes together with fault tolerance and using DHT (distributed hash tables), which _enables retrieval of
the file pieces without needing a central directory_.
